Introduction:
The project aims to revolutionize the early detection of brain tumors by implementing behavioural analysis techniques, specifically focusing on keyboard dynamics and mouse movement patterns. Traditional methods of brain tumor detection often rely on symptoms or imaging technologies, which may lead to delays in diagnosis and suboptimal treatment outcomes. By harnessing advanced machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to develop an innovative authentication system that analyzes unique behavioural patterns exhibited during keyboard interactions and mouse movements for early identification of potential brain tumor indicators.

Objectives:
Develop a robust and user-friendly authentication mechanism for early brain tumor detection.
Collect and analyze behavioural data from users to create distinctive profiles for identification.
Implement advanced machine learning algorithms to detect subtle changes in behavioural patterns indicative of brain tumor development.
Establish real-time authentication capabilities and continuous monitoring to enhance detection accuracy and security.
Evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the developed system through rigorous testing and validation procedures.

Approach:
Data Collection: Gather behavioural data from users through keyboard interactions and mouse movements.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the collected behavioural data to create individualized profiles.
Machine Learning Models: Train machine learning algorithms to detect deviations from normal behavioural patterns associated with brain tumor indicators.
Real-Time Authentication: Implement the developed system for real-time authentication and continuous monitoring of users' behavioural patterns.
Evaluation and Validation: Assess the performance of the system using simulated and real-world scenarios, including sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive rates.
Iterative Improvement: Continuously refine the system based on feedback and insights gained from evaluation results to enhance detection accuracy and usability.

Expected Outcomes:
Development of an innovative authentication system for early detection of brain tumors.
Improved accuracy and timeliness in identifying potential brain tumor indicators through behavioural analysis.
Enhanced security measures and user experience compared to traditional methods of brain tumor detection.
Contribution to the advancement of early detection technologies and strategies in the field of neurology and healthcare.

Conclusion:
The project endeavors to leverage behavioural analysis techniques to transform the landscape of early brain tumor detection. By combining advanced machine learning algorithms with user-friendly authentication mechanisms, the system aims to provide a proactive approach to identifying potential brain tumor indicators, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes and patient care.
